I am an Assistant Professor in the McComish Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at South Dakota State University, where I lead the <a href="https://github.com/Multimodal-Intelligence-Lab"><i><span class="mint-green">M</span>ultimodal <span class="mint-green">Int</span>elligence Lab</i></a>. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/) under [Dr. Leen-Kiat Soh](https://cse.unl.edu/~lksoh/). Prior to that, I completed my B.S. from SDSU (dual-degree with the University of Ulsan) in 2015 and an M.S. from SDSU in 2017. 



My research focuses on **scientific knowledge discovery from large-scale multimodal data**, aiming to answer: *how AI and human expertise can work together to unlock knowledge hidden in large-scale multimodal data, driving greater **accessibility** and **discoverability**?*

To advance this vision, my work spans **information retrieval**, **multimodal learning**, **visual reasoning**, **multimedia analysis**, **knowledge graphs**, and **eXplainable AI**.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
