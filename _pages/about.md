I am an Assistant Professor in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at South Dakota State University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/) under [Dr. Leen-Kiat Soh](https://cse.unl.edu/~lksoh/). Prior to that, I completed my BS and MS degrees at South Dakota State University in 2015 and 2017, respectively. The long-term vision of my research is to **establish the fundamental framework for computer vision system to support human users**. Progressing towards this vision, I am actively conducting my research in the following areas: **image processing**, **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **document understanding**, **medical image analysis**, and **visual question answering**.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
