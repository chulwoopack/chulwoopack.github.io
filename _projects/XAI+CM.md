## Summary
<hr>
This research aims to explore the practical effectiveness of existing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques in construction safety applications, with a focus on fall detectionâ€”one of the leading causes of workplace injuries. Despite the increasing adoption of AI-driven safety solutions, their opaque decision-making processes pose challenges in trust, usability, and regulatory compliance. To bridge this gap, this study proposes the development of an `XAI-integrated vision-based fall detection alert framework` designed to deliver practical and actionable insights tailored for enhancing construction site safety. The Craig and Diane Martin National Center for Construction Safety, University of Kansas, will support this project by facilitating real-world implementation and validation.
The project will focus on generating preliminary findings on the practicality of an XAI-integrated vision-based safety monitoring system, emphasizing three widely used explainability approaches: feature saliency-based, perturbation-based, and concept-based explanations. This framework is designed to triangulate the construction safety insights, ensuring a comprehensive and interpretable understanding of safety risk. Stakeholder feedback from construction safety professionals will be collected to assess the practical utility and acceptance of XAI-driven alerts.
