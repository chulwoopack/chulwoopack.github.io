<p class="post-description">Personalizable ITS: To create an automated problem and solution generator leveraging knowledge graph-powered video comprehension</p>
## Summary
<hr>
The overarching goal of this project is to enhance learning experience, improve learning outcomes, and support teachers by developing a novel, interactive tutoring system that integrates teacher feedback and enhances accessibility. The project proposes to create an automated problem and solution generator that is individually differentiated and tailored to the diverse needs of learners, enhanced by teacher feedback.
