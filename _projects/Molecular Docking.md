## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered pipeline for **drug discovery** by integrating **molecular docking simulations**, **knowledge graph reasoning**, and **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques. Our goal is to accelerate lead compound identification and provide interpretable insights into protein-ligand interactions, enabling researchers to understand *why* certain drug candidates are predicted to be effective.



## Key Objectives
- Build an automated molecular docking framework powered by deep learning models.
- Construct a domain-specific biomedical knowledge graph for drug-target relationships.
- Integrate graph reasoning and link prediction for novel drug-target interaction discovery.
- Develop XAI methods to provide human-understandable explanations for docking results and predictions.



## Methods & Approach
- **Molecular Docking:** Use classical docking tools (AutoDock Vina, RDKit) enhanced by graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict binding affinities and pose ranking.
- **Knowledge Graph:** Construct a large-scale drug-target-pathway knowledge graph using biomedical databases (DrugBank, ChEMBL).
- **Reasoning:** Employ graph-based algorithms (e.g., R-GCN, TransE) for link prediction and candidate discovery.
- **XAI:** Apply feature attribution (SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and attention-based visualization to interpret molecular features driving predictions.
- **Evaluation:** Benchmark against known datasets (PDBBind, BindingDB) and compare with traditional docking approaches.



## Current Progress
<!-- - Built a prototype molecular docking pipeline combining AutoDock with GNN-based re-ranking. -->
<!-- - Constructed a preliminary biomedical knowledge graph with 1M+ entities and 5M+ relations. -->
<!-- - Integrated SHAP-based explanations to highlight molecular substructures influencing binding predictions. -->



## Applications
- Accelerated lead compound screening for drug discovery.
- Discovery of novel drug-target interactions using graph reasoning.
- Interpretable drug design to support medicinal chemistry and pharmacology research.
