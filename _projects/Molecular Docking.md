<p class="post-description">Establishing Infrastructure for AI-Driven Discovery of Small Molecules to Combat Antibiotic Resistance, Biofilms, and Aflatoxin Contamination</p>
## Summary
<hr>
This research aims to investigates the fundamental interactions between small molecules and proteins to identify compounds capable of combating bacteria, biofilm maintenance, and fungal aflatoxin contamination. An interjurisdictional (SDSU, SDMT, UNLV), interdisciplinary (biologists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists) team will collaborate to leverage cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, accelerating the discovery of bioactive molecules.
